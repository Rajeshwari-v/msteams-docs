# Tutorials and code samples for the Microsoft Teams developer platform

Here you will find a list of tutorials and code samples that demonstrate how you can extend the Teams developer platform capabilities by creating custom apps.

## Getting started with Microsoft Learn

| Conversational bots  | [Create interactive conversational bots for Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msteams-conversation-bots/)  |

## Getting started with code samples

To download our samples from GitHub:

1. Select one of the projects listed below and open the project in GitHub.
2. Choose the **Clone or download** button and copy the URL
3. Open a command prompt in the parent directory into which you want to install the sample project
4. Run `git clone <pasted url>`

### For .NET/C# samples

Each of our .NET samples includes a Visual Studio solution file that can build the solution fully, including restoring the NuGet packages.

### For Node.js samples

We provide a packages.json file that lists all required packages for a sample. Simply run `npm install` from the command line in your Node.js project directory to install the required packages. You're now ready to open the project in Visual Studio Code and start experimenting.

### For other samples

As always, the project's README file should have more information on specific needs for specific samples.

## Bots (using the v4 SDK)
