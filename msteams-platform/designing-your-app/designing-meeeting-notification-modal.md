# Designing a meeting extension notification modal

Notification modals display on the Teams meeting stage for simple user interactions. They're a subtle way to quickly capture input that doesn't interrupt the meeting.

## Use cases

You might create a notification modal so users can:

* Provide brief feedback
* Take a short survey
* Submit approvals
* Get reminders

## Example

The following example shows what a notification modal might look like from a meeting participant's perspective.

## Anatomy

Notification modals are responsive and have the following dimensions:

* **Width**: Minimum 280 pixels and maximum 460 pixels
* **Height**: 400 pixels (300 for the content area)

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-anatomy.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

1. **Avatar**: User who initiated the notification modal.
1. **App attribution**: Icon and name.
1. **Action string**: Describes what the user who initiated the modal wants to do.
1. **More actions**: Provides options on hover that include:
   * Mute notifications from the app during the meeting
   * Dismiss all notifications on the screen
   * Manage notification settings
   * Use an action-based messaging extension
   * Expand the notification on the meeting stage
1. **Dimiss**: Dismisses a single notification. Always use the upper-right close icon.
1. **Actions**: Optional; depends on your use case.
1. **Input error**: When required, displays a short error message.
1. **Aggregate count**: When required, shows if there's more than one active modal (count includes all apps).
1. **Webview**: Displays all third-party content. Learn about [webview dimensions](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=218%3A8829).

## Behavior

Remember if your notification modal requires scrolling:

* You should only be able to scroll vertically.
* You can only see the content you've scrolled to (nothing above or below).
* The scrollbar is part of the webview content.

## Components

Notification modals are built primarily with the following UI components (which are based on the [Fluent UI Design System](https://fluentsite.z22.web.core.windows.net/)).

Component | Guidelines | Example
 - | - | -
[Button](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=214%3A10089) | Primary and secondary buttons can be medium or small | Send a response
[Input](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=214%3A10102) | Field for brief user input. Label text can include an icon  | Enter feedback
[Dropdown](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=214%3A10115) | Select one or more options from a list. Can include search and multi-selection features | Choose a language
[Selection controls](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=214%3A10128) | Use checkboxes for multiple choices or radio buttons and toggles for single choices. For more detailed selections, use a slider | Vote in a poll
[Error banners](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=214%3A10141) | Whether displaying an urgent message, error state, or warning, the message should be short and won't interrupt the user's current task | Display issue when submitting a response

## Theming

These Teams-specific guidelines can help you quickly and confidently choose the right colors and typography.

### Colors

Use the [recommended color scheme](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=280%3A4030) for backgrounds, foregrounds, and conveying states in notification modals.

[See the full color scheme](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=257%3A15339)

### Typography

Use the [recommended font sizes and weights](https://www.figma.com/file/QjjWsZYpNqwjRc3OXTgBpp/Principles-and-guidelines?node-id=257%3A15511) for titles, body text, and metadata text.

## Best practices

While notification modals can make meetings more effective, they also can derail meetings if too obtrusive. In general, use notification modals sparingly and make sure they follow these guidelines.

### Navigation

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-steps-do.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

#### Do: Keep it contained

Limit modal content to a single screen so users can focus on the meeting.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-steps-dont.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

#### Don't: Include multiple steps

Modals shouldn't require users to navigate through content.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Interactions

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-interactions-do.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-interactions-dont.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-right-pane-do.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

#### Do: Limit interactions

Remove unnecessary content that doesn't help users accomplish something quickly. If you need complex interactions, use a single column on the right pane instead.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-right-pane-dont.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

#### Don't: Use complex interactions

You may be able to design a single modal with multiple interactions, but too many can distract from the meeting.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Layout

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-layout-do.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

#### Do: Use single-column layouts

Since modals are at the center of the meeting stage, task completion should be fast and simple to avoid user frustration.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-layout-dont.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

#### Don't: Clutter the space

Dense content can be distracting and overwhelming, especially during a meeting.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Size

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-size-do.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

#### Do: Use a consistent size

Important because notification modals always display in the same location.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/calls-and-meetings/notification-modal-size-dont.png" alt-text="Alt text here." border="false":::

#### Don't: Use different sizes

Multiple sizes within the same app is an inconsistent experience.

## Validate your design

If you plan to publish your app to AppSource, you should understand what design issues commonly cause apps to fail during submission.
